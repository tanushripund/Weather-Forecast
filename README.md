# Weather-Forecast
Generic weather applications, for instance, typically provide standard features like current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a multi-day forecast. However, they may suffer from information overload, presenting too much data that can overwhelm a casual user. Some applications might also lack a streamlined user interface, making navigation cumbersome or critical information hard to find. The aesthetic appeal and user experience can vary widely, with some feeling outdated or less intuitive.
